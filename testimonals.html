                    Recently, I visited the Ministry of Health in Trinidad and Tobago in efforts to get help concerning an ailing issue I have. 
                    The overall effect is not as horrible; at least there, those who do service had come closer and behaved formally: advising the procedures, requirement documents for going forward into the proceedings accordingly. 
                    In fact, I was pleased with how efficiently my queries were dealt with, and also how the office maintained a high level of organization and cleanliness. 
                    In general, the atmosphere was of help and concern, making it easier to pass through the procedures that had to be followed. 
                    I thank them for the support provided and for the Ministry's commitment to public health.

                    My visit to the Ministry of Health was generally quite a good experience. The personnel were very polite and professional; they availed the information I required. 
                    However, I felt the entire process took a little more time than I had anticipated because it involved several processes with some time spent in transit. 
                    While the staff were trying to do their best to help me out, the delay was somewhat irritating. 
                    Anyway, I was impressed that they tried to handle everything well, and I got what I needed in the form of information and documents. 
                    Of course, that would have been more or less great if everything was put into a smoother process. Well, thank you, anyway.

                    My visit to the Ministry of Health was so disappointing. I expected that at least some important information could be obtained, but no one was around to attend to me.
                    I had been waiting for a while for queries to be attended; talk of slowness even in giving simple information. 
                    Without staff and such a long wait, it was frustrating and not effective. I left unsatisfied, concerned about the level of 
                    service received since it did not meet the standards that I expected from a government office.
